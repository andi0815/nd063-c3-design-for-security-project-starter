# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
* Move WebServiceInstance to Private Subnet
* Disallow public access to all S3 buckets

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
Yes, in case we restrict the source IPs that may access the bucket, it will help to prevent access from attacking hosts, directly.

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
No, it has to be encrypted "manually" afterwards, see e.g.: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/storage/encrypting-objects-with-amazon-s3-batch-operations/

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
As long as all changes have been made by modifying the existing environment, the original config should have been applied again, but the data will remain encrpyted.
In case the changes have been made manually, single steps may fail.
