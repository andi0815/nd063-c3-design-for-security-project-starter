# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

Guard Duty did not show any findings up to now...
This seems to be a general problem, see e.g.: https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/784769

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

As source of information AWS GuardDuty uses: event logs, VPC Flow Logs and DNS log involving the following AWS resource types: IAM access keys, EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and Amazon EKS resources.

To detect an attack, Gard Duty could make use of an increased amount of login failures at IAM.
Additionally, on EC2 level an increased amount of failed login attempts on port 22 (from the same source) could be determined.
